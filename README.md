## Overview

Welcome to the Underworld!  Imp is an object-oriented programming language that compiles to C++.  Imp is short for:

* Imperative
* Implementation
* sImple	
* Implicit
* Imps

"simple is simplified simplified, and imp is simplified simple"

or

"simple is simpler than simplified, and imp is simpler than simple"

Imp is a humble language, which means:

* Imp exists to serve C++ (and the Overlord), not the other way around.
* Imp is not fancy or revolutionary.

## Compiling

### Archmage
Imp requires ArchMage, which requires Node.js

From inside the imp directory run:

`arch`

### CMake



### MSVC
