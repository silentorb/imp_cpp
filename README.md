## Overview

Welcome to the Underworld!  Imp is an object-oriented programming language that compiles to C++.  Imp is short for:

* Imperative
* Implementation
* sImple	
* Implicit
* Imps

"simple is simpler simpler, and imp is simpler simple"

Imp is a humble language, which means:

* Imp exists to serve C++ (and the Overlord), not the other way around.
* Imp is not fancy or revolutionary.
